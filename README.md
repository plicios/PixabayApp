# PixabayApp

## Configuration
Before running the app - please add your pixabay api key into apikey.properties file (copy apikey.properties.example into apikey.properties) - You can get the key from here - https://pixabay.com/api/docs/#api_search_images

## API Configuration
The API URL can be changed in build.gradle file in app module, so it can be easily set to different url depending on some flavour (due to not having any flavours at the moment it is in defaultConfig)
